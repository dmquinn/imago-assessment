# Assessment for Imago

## Task

The brief for this project was to create a website using JavaScript and React.\
This website connects to a RESTful API to send requests and receive responses.\
The website is able to show media previews and help the customer select the media they want to purchase.
### to run this app use: 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Challenges

Using the mock Postman API was new to me, so took a minute to figure out.\
The search feature works as intended when observaing the network tab, but images don't update.  This is the same in the provided example requests provided so I have assumed in this exercise it is enough to demonstrate ability to use dynamic queries.\
Time restrictions meant that the design is not precise to the provided Figma file.

## What can be improved?

The 'x to close' functionality in the search bar component does not work correctly.\
The design is still not 100% accurate to the Figma file.\
Responsiveness is overall good, but on screen sizes between tablet and desktop gaps between images can be seen.
